<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I have a background in front-end development, combined with hands-on experience managing IT hardware and networks. On completing my IT-focused military service, I am eager to return to coding and deep into the fog of creative programming.
</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</li>
  <li>Backend: Node.js (basic), REST APIs</li>
  <li>IT: Network troubleshooting, hardware maintenance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Goals</h2>
<p>
I am currently working on a new project to showcase my skills in both frontend and backend development. My aim is to build dynamic, user-focused web applications while exploring modern technologies.
